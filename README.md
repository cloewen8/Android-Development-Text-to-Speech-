# Overview
My project will focus on text-to-speech and playing sound files to recreate a game called [Homestar Talker](https://homestarrunner.com/talky2.html). Which is a game about putting words together. The game will award players based on the combinations they achieve.

# Implementation
I plan to remake a game called Homestar Talker. In this game you are presented with a variety of words. Your goal is to create a 7-word phrase. Homestar, the main character, will say each word you click on.
The app will include:
- An activity with buttons that can be clicked on to say their word.
- A Textbox with a score based on created phrases (with higher amounts correlating to longer phrases).
- An options menu to toggle between the home and preferences activity.
- A preferences activity to control audio playback (the score multiplier, muting and unmuting the sound effects, and a slider for playback directionality).
